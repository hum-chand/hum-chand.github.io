<p>Our understanding of astronomy, astrophysics and space science, which draws upon our knowledge of different branches of physics and other disciplines, is fundamental to our understanding of the Universe.  In this context,
an ONLINE Faculty Development Programme (FDP), CUHP-IUCAA Training in Astronomical Research and Education (FDP-CITARE:I), is being organised in the Shivalik region shortly for the first time, primarily for the Physics teachers of  College/University primarily in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.</p>

<p>You are invited to express your interest to participate in this FDP-CITARE:I  by filling out the following Google form before 30st November 2022.</p>

<p>FILL OUT IN GOOGLE FORM</p>

<p>The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in <a href="https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml">_config.yml</a>, which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site‚Äôs github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in <a href="https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml">_data/navigation.yml</a>. For example, if you don‚Äôt have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.</p>

<h2 id="create-content--metadata">Create content &amp; metadata</h2>
<p>For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the <a href="https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks">_talks directory</a>. At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the <a href="https://academicpages.github.io/talks">Talks page</a>, each <a href="https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1">individual page</a> for specific talks, the talks section for the <a href="https://academicpages.github.io/cv">CV page</a>, and the <a href="https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html">map of places you‚Äôve given a talk</a> (if you run this <a href="https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py">python file</a> or <a href="https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb">Jupyter notebook</a>, which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).</p>

<p><strong>Markdown generator</strong></p>

<p>I have also created <a href="https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator">a set of Jupyter notebooks</a> that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-edit-your-sites-github-repository">How to edit your site‚Äôs GitHub repository</h2>
<p>Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub‚Äôs servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like <a href="https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md">this one</a> and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the ‚ÄúRaw | Blame | History‚Äù buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the ‚ÄúCreate new file‚Äù or ‚ÄúUpload files‚Äù buttons.</p>
