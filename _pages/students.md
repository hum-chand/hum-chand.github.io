**Abstract**: Even with large telescope apertures and vast improvements in detector technology, resolving the inner
regions of active galaxies remains a formidable challenge. Nevertheless, understanding the innermost
regions of these galaxies is critical to understanding the galaxy evolution and the structure and dynamics of
matter in the vicinity of a Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH). In this thesis, we have explored indirect methods
to further our understanding of the innermost regions in Active galactic nuclei (AGN). [More detail here](/students/2013-03-01-Ravi-Joshi.md)
