Ongoing Outreach:
================
We believes that the benefits of high-quality science education and infrastructure should not remain restricted to members of the CUHP only. As an attempt to spread the excitement of science and to make the expertise and facilities at CUHP available to the science and education community of the Himachal Pradesh, we would like to engage in several “Science, Technology, and Astronomy Realisation (STAR)” outreach activities. These encompass skywatching programs, social outreach in the local community, capacity building of teachers, making and popularizing simple science toys, and effectively communicating scientific research through various media. In this context the Department of Physics and Astronomical Science of CIHP proposed to set up a Chandra “Science, Technology and Astronomy Realisation (STAR)” Club [Chandra- STAR-Club] at CUHP, named after renowned nobel laureate and the father of astrophysics, Prof. S. Chandrasekhar.

Science Popularization
======================

Setting up Science Center at ARIES

-   Setting up Science Center at ARIES.

-   Model-Cum-Book Exhibition center at ARIES.

-   14 Inch Telescope for Live Telecast and Night Sky Watching Program.

-   5m Fixed Dome digital Planetarium.

-   Mobile observatory (3-inch optical and solar telescope).

-   Scientific poster for science popularization (about 4-5 dozen fix
    frame poster made).

-   MoU has been signed for collaborative work with \"Vigyan Prasar\" to
    work together for science popularization, which include collecting
    science popularization books and audio/video media repositories to
    show to the visitor. A permanents exhibition center with
    books/exhibits (at manufacture cost for visitor) in collaboration
    with \"Vigyan Prasar\" has been also setup at ARIES science center.
